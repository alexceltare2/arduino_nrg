This library for Arduino IDE 1.6 implements SWAP on top of any existing
ISM radio as far as the necessary hardware cores exist. Take a look at
our repository containing the cores to see how to port your radio for SWAP.

SWAP stands for Simple Wireless Abstract Protocol and is designed to turn
simple wireless nodes into powerful interoperable devices programmable
the Arduino IDE:

panStamp is fully supporting SWAP, which has proven to be a serious
alternative to other oversized and overkilled protocols like Zigbee.
SWAP usually requires less than 8 KB of flash space and less than 1 KB of RAM.

SWAP is not a true MESH technology. However, it is able to implement a good
amount of very different topologies, including star, point-to-point and
mixed coordinated-autonomous cells.
